# instagram_script

Currently just uses manually copied/pasted text files

To do:
- ~ Cleanup input to remove actual names, sticking just to usernames ~
- Output to another file instead of just printing
- Extract directly from account
  - via HTML file?
  - ~Does instagram have an API?~ - it does, but I'd need a dev license
